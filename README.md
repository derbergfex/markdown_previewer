# markdown_previewer

## Description
This Markdown Previewer allows the user to type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area. The user can then see a preview of the output of their markdown that is updated as they type. The project uses React.js, the Sass preprocessor for CSS, Bootstrap 3.3.7, and the [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked#marked) parser and compiler. 

The project can be viewed (here)[http://markdown.previewer.surge.sh].

## Running the project on your local server
To run the project on your local server, make sure you have installed React (and Babel), Sass and 'marked'. Simply download the files, and in your command line type `cd markdown_previewer` so that you are in the correct directory. And then go ahead and type, `npm start` given that you have installed all your dependencies.
